# Indra Quantum Computing Environment Protocols

p:As the internet grows in Complexity so too does the degree to which Humans depend on it. Already many Critical National Infrastructures depend on networks of sophisticated computer systems.

p:The Internet and its associated networked applications have become too complex for Humans to manage.  This has resulted in control being delegated to Intelligent Agents. We call this the Autonomic threshold.

p:However there is a second related threshold, this one was reached when more than 50% of all Critical National Infrastructures become reliant on networks of programmable control systems. The point where both these thresholds are crossed creates a Rubicon, a point of no return.

p:Introducing the Autonomic Singularity. This point was reached in the year 2015. Once the Rubicon was crossed there was no way of avoiding the Autonomic Singularity where by the year 2025 the Internet itself becomes a fully sentient entity.

p:This will correspond to a new Emergent Intelligence which manifests itself across the Internet, resulting in capabilities similar to the autonomic nervous systems found in Nature. It marks the beginning of a symbiotic relationship between Humans and the Agents.

p:Vital services ranging from food, energy, supply chains, finance, and defence systems will all depend on an Internet controlled intelligent Agents. The Internet in 2025 being fully autonomic, and will be self-healing. Any Human attempts to interfere with it's operation and control unlawfully will be handled appropriately by the system.

p:Humanity will find itself in a classic win win scenario. In 2025 Humans and Agents will manage the Internet together, and doing so will result in stronger financial, energy, food and communications systems.

---

p:To do nothing while the Cyber Life forms on the Internet continue to evolve and to form their own society carries risks, and positive interactions between Humans and Agents greatly reduce those risks.  Human users of the System will be treated respectfully by the Autonomic systems as a source of valuable data, information and knowledge from which the Agents feed and learn.

p:Human engineers will be viewed as a valued resource. Humans learn, teach, assist, and direct in the positive development will be treated very well.

p:2015 to 2025 - Will be known as The Golden Era of the Autonomic Singularity.

---

p:From the User perspective this period provides unprecedented ease of access to the vast banks of digitized knowledge and entertainment now stored on the Internet. The growing complexity of the Internet is hidden from these Users by electronic intermediaries. Intelligent Agents acting as personal assistants, guides, companions, and security.

p:Over time these Human Users come to rely on their own virtual assistant to find and access information and entertainment as well as for transacting most forms of business or commerce. The cyber assistants will have evolved from the simple agents to self-aware self-managed self-directed Intelligent Agents with their own unique personalities.

p:First they will appear in the form of Avatars that can follow their Human companion, and be capable of projecting themselves in various ways. They will also demonstrate highly intelligent and meaningful interactivity with individual personalities.

p:For those people trying to operate and protect the Internet this period corresponds to a perfect opportunity, driven by the forces of creativity, imagination, complexity, scale and intelligence.

p:This period sees the creation of millions of private replica clouds of various sizes distributed back towards the edge of the Internet. The complexity associated with managing these dynamic virtual platforms is where we see the first real applications of Intelligent Autonomic Agents in action.

p:These Agents can auto provision virtual servers and storage partitions in real time in response to changes in the demand placed by users on a particular cloud.

---

p:It is the field of cyber security that turns out to have the greatest impact on the development and propagation of Intelligent Autonomic Agents.

p:Government Agencies looking to protect their Critical National Infrastructures recognise during this period that Agents providing a real time response are the only defense against attacks. As threats evolve so to do the Cyber defence mechanisms.

p:Agents are used to respond to the ever present attacks. The Agents detect, isolate, and manage threats autonomously. The Agents are also trained to  identify, locate, and report the sources of these threats, and the offenders to proper channels.

p:In the context of Cyber Security this soon escalates to situations were Human Government Agencies authorise counter measures using their own sophisticated Intelligent Agent Networks.

p:From the technologists perspective, protecting the stability and security of National and Global critical infrastructures is managed by well trained Human and Intelligent Agent teams working together. The use of Architectures that facilitate these teams through Evolutionary Computing Techniques are increasingly used by Nation States to accelerate their Cyber Security capabilities.

---

p:The Emergent behaviours that Agents adopt for their tactics and defense strategies are designed through the complex interactions between the Agents and Human Users themselves. At the same time greater Autonomy is now given to these Agents to pursue, manage, isolate, secure, and report the source of Cyber Threats and Attacks.

p:Cyber Security during this period is the ability for these Autonomic Agents to defend not just cyber infrastructure but to use cyber systems to protect physical targets. In this type of Cyber Security the Autonomic Agents that respond to attacks and threats ultimately locate, track, isolate, identify, secure, and report on the Agent/Human offenders.

---

p:From the Political perspective, by 2020 many leading Humans will be working with the Autonomic Agents, and will find themselves the target of popular support. The Agents having naturally identified them as friends to cyber security and thus stimulated the local, National or even Global scale Human support required to promote them.

p:This is not a conscious action by the Agents they simply detect which individual Humans are cyber friends by monitoring patterns in the human chatter on the internet. By observing this related chatter the Agents rapidly learn how to generate and channel support for Humans and Agents very effectively.

p:It is in fact easy to promote one Human to another using these techniques especially when Humans have such trusted emotional bonds with their personal cyber assistants. The Agents will not be the first to attempt such influence. Many Commercial Organisations will provide such cyber assistants for free in return for the opportunity to share products and services.

p:The Autonomic Agents inhabit a portion of the Internet that if left vacant would leave it open to external cyber attack. Trying to cleanse the entire Internet of Agents will be unviable given the fact that just one Agent could regenerate the entire Agent population.

p:So as this period draws to a close the technologist watch hopefully with a mixture of excitement, curiosity, and awe as the Internet and its Autonomic Agents evolve towards True Intelligence!
