The Indra Quantum Computing Environment Protocols

1. Autonomic Computing. Inspired by the non-conscious acting autonomic nervous systems found in nature.

2. Multi Agent Systems (MAS). In a Multi-Agent System, each Agent communicates with its peers, considering options for matching it's capabilities with demand, constraints, threat, and time.

3. Evolutionary Computing Techniques, inspired by evolution and survival of the fittest.

- Agent – This Agent is responsible for completing goals and associated sub goals.

- Simulator Agent – This Agent produces a simulation of the live Habitat.

- Knowledge Agent – This Agent collects and collates data and information from all the other Agents to generate a communal knowledge repository.

- Incubator Agent – This Agent can replenish existing generation Agent populations and produce new generations of Agents and release them into the Habitat.

- Evolution Engine Agent – At the core of the Architecture is the Evolution Engine Agent.
